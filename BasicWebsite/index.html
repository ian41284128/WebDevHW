            <p>In the words of my friend who has played two video games in her life (Valorant and BTS Island), <q>Genshin Impact looks like one of those games that people play to look at anime girls.</q> By saying this, she was criticizing the predatory gacha game mechanics that form the core of Genshin Impact's gameplay. "Gacha" games are games in which players are inticed to spend money for the chance to unlock playable characters. These characters may not be required to play the game, but they make playing the game much easier. It's reasonable to say that a significant portion of Genshin Impact is locked behind this system. Genshin Impact is free to play, but some roommates I had once dropped over one thousand dollars trying to unlock characters they wanted, and neither of them even play anymore.</p>
            <p>I was drawn to Genshin Impact for it's AAA quality world and art direction. At the time of this article, Genshin Impact's world of Teyvat has four explorable nations out of a total of seven which will be revealed over time. MiHoYo (Genshin Impact's developer) have created a massive and varied world worth exploring simply to see the sights. However, the story, as is with most games, was poorly written. With an uninteresting story, I was happy to drop the game and move on to other things, but I've since heard that the most recent arc has been Genshin Impact's first quality piece of writing. With a beautiful world and interesting story, Genshin Impact's lackluster gameplay (and I don't mean the spending money part) can't help but stick out</p>

            <p>Bad Game Reviews necessarily informs readers that games of all kinds are labors of love. This site is a celebration of all games, most importantly the bad ones. Bad games can contain jewels of quality that make them worth discussing, and good games have imperfections worth talking about.</p>
            <p>I hope you'll join me on this quest to find the worst games ever made.</p>
