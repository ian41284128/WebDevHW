**Dan Bing**[^1] is a taiwanese breakfast wrap. It's basically a "crepe"[^2] filled with fried egg and green onion. It's a little crunchy and savory. Dan bing is easy to make and you can store the prepped ingredients for even quicker cooking.

## Ingredients
- Flour
- corn starch
- water
- eggs
- green onion
- soy sauce
- sesame oil
- chili oil

## Directions
### Prep
1. Combine flour and water in a bowl until you have a somewhat watery but not totally liquid mixture. Add a bit of corn starch.
2. In another bowl, whisk like three or four eggs.
3. Chop enough green onions to disperse evenly into the egg mixture and then disperse the chopped green onion evenly into the egg mixture.
4. In a small sauce bowl, combine soy sauce, sesame oil and chili oil. The amounts are really a preference thing. If you have chives or parsley you can add some as well.
### Making the tortilla/crepe
5. Add olive oil to pan and heat on medium-low.
6. Once olive oil has the wavey texture, pour enough of the flour mixture into the center of the pan to create a thin crepe about the size of the pan.
7. Using a spatula, carefully spread the top of the liquid over the whole pan, moving in a circular spiral from the center of the pan until you have a round tortilla shape. Take care not to be too forceful which can tear the flour before it cooks through.
8. Let it cook until the bottom is slightly browned and then flip it and cook the other side.
9. Once the tortilla is slightly crispy on the edges, take it out of the pan and place on a plate. At this point you can continue making tortillas if you want to make more than one serving.
### Making the Dan Bing
10. After adding more oil, pour your egg mixture into the center of the pan and quickly spread it around in the same way you did with the flour mixture. You don't have to be as careful here.
11. Once the egg is spread on the pan, gently place your tortilla on top of the egg mixture.
12. Let the egg set and attach to the tortilla. Once this is done, flip the tortilla and egg mixture over. You can let this cook until you are happy.
13. Fold one side of the tortilla over about a third of the total, covering the egg inside.
14. Bring the tortilla closer to you in the pan and fold the near side over the far side.
15. Press down on it to solidify the shape, and then optionally cut it into three pieces with the spatula in the pan, or once it's out with a pair of scissors.
16. Once it is on a plate, pour sauce over the pieces and serve.
