        <h1>A Semester of Running</h1>
        <p>The next day, David made me download <span class="i">Nike Run Club</span> on my phone to track our progress. <span class="i">Nike Run Club</span> (NRC) is a workout tracker app that uses your phone's gps to record the path you ran, your speed, records, and other interesting statistics. After a run, you can see a map graphing the route you ran, drawn in a gradient from <span class="rtg">red to green</span>, representing how <span class="rtg">slow or fast</span> you ran at every segment of your route.</p>

            <h3>Cramps</h3>
            <p>
                For the first few weeks, every run hurt more than the last. There is breathlessness, but the cramps which had me holding my side with one hand were the worst. On good days they would start after the first mile, but most of the time it was an immediate sharp feeling that grew as the run continued. I think this is what running feels like for most people when they start, and also the reason most people stop.

            <h3>Water</h3>
            <p>
                That's when I realized, all my life, I've been dehydrated. I told David right away.
            </p>
            <p>
                "You haven't been drinking water?" David was shocked. I said, "No?" I'm just an average person who drinks a maximum of four cups of water a day. When my lips chap I use chapstick.
            </p>
            <p>
                After that, every night before a run, I chugged my daily allowance of water in the space of a couple hours. Perhaps not conventional, but it worked like a charm. No more cramps!

            <h3>New Shoes</h3>
            <p>
                It's time. I've been wearing a pair of three year old Brooks trail shoes since September. They've been with me to China and back, but they had become old and stiff - their time had come. On the first day of November, me and David hiked up and down New York City looking to get them replaced. First, we went to a store called FleetFeet, which has a cool machine that scans your feet and recommends shoes for you. We got my feet scanned, heard my recommendations, and then left to find deals on Amazon. In the end, though, I settled on a pair of <span class="b">Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 39s</span>, or just Pegs for short. Armed with a birthday discount and a new Nike member deal, we got the perfect pair of gateway shoes.

            <h3>The RUNYU 5K</h3>
            <p>
                Four days after getting my new shoes, it was time for my first ever official 5k. Little did we know, it wasn't all going to go according to plan. The day of the 5k, me and David got together and walked to NYU's Grammercy dorm. From there, we would get briefed on our route and make our way to the start line. For many, a room full of runners is a sight to cringe at, but the energy was exciting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The run began a little further down the route me and David ran every day, so I was ready and familiar. I tried my best to stick to the front group, but pretty soon, David and the rest of the good runners dropped me. That's okay though, I was in the chase pack. The last mile was tough, but I pushed ahead, and managed to pass a couple people before reaching the end. At one point, I heard someone hiss an expletive as I passed them. I'm not usually a competitive person, but there's something invigorating about racing against other people. I think I really like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As I reached the finish line, I found David comparing his gps to another runner's. Turns out NYU measured the distance wrong, so it wasn't really a full 5K. We all decided to run the extra 0.2 miles and finish it out.

            <h3>Shaking Out</h3>
            <p>
                With the RUNYU 5K out of the way, me and David decided to try something a little better managed - a local "Turkeytrot" race near David's hometown. Turkeytrots are 5Ks raced on thanksgiving day. But before we went, it was important to do a shakeout run - an easy run just to make sure everything is feeling alright.
            </p>
            <p>
                That day, we were talking and running a slow pace down the Hudson. I didn't notice at the time, but the tweak I felt in my leg that day would become a big issue in a couple months time.

            <h3>The Turkeytrot</h3>
            <p>
                The day before Thanksgiving, I went back to New Jersey with David to stay the night before the race. Thanksgiving morning at 7:00AM, we drove out to the 5K: a simple route going through a small neighborhood. There were parents racing with strollers, children, and grandparents, but we all got running bibs, so it felt very official.
            </p>
            <p>
                I finished the race in 24 minutes and 19 seconds. I came in 76th place overall. I was 60th place in the men's bracket, but 54th place in the men over 13 bracket, meaning that six boys under 13 ran a faster time than me. Unfortunate.

            <h2>Three Months Later...</h2>
            <p>
                And just like that, a whole semester has gone by. One of the best things about <span class="i">Nike Run Club</span> is that after all this time, I can look back and see my progress in numbers. By early December, I recorded <span class="b">84.6 total miles</span> in NRC. My longest run was <span class="b">5.82 miles</span> (in 50 minutes.) My fastest mile was <span class="b">7:01 minutes</span>, though technically I took a few breaks so it doesn't really count, and I ran <span class="b">two official 5k races</span>, with a personal best time of <span class="b">24 minutes</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's not much, but I can feel myself improving. Month by month, running has become a routine in my life. But as hobbies and interests start to take up more of my time and energy, I reach a point where I question the value of what I'm doing. I have always struggled to do things only for fun; without goals or a purpose I worry I'm wasting my time on something meaningless.
            </p>

                Running has been a lot more than just records to me. Each day, running makes me wake up Before 10:00AM. I drink more water now. And after runs I eat and hang out with my friends. After my runs with David, we both shower and then meet up to eat lunch and watch random running media he finds. One tv show in particular stands out, called:
