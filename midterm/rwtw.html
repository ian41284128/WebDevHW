        <h1>My Whole Life is Running Now :/</h1>
        <h5>aka when my running blog turns into an anime review page</h5>
        <p>
            Halfway through the semester, me and David started watching an anime called <span class="i">Run With the Wind</span> after school. It's made by the same studio that animated <span class="i">Haikyuu</span> but on a slightly lower budget. There's something special about watching a show depicting characters doing almost exactly what you are trying to do in your life.

        <p>
            <span class="i">Run With the Wind</span> starts off slow, and because of the low budget it doesn't look great. It took a minute, and for those who have watched anime before, you might understand that it takes some time to get used to watching anime again after a while. But once I did, the story of <span class="i">Run With the Wind</span> became one of my favorite television storylines of all time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="i">Run With the Wind</span> follows a running club made up of one incredibly talented high school runner, eight other college students who have never run in their lives, and one injured senior whose dream is to run the Hakone Ekiden. The Hakone Ekiden is one of Japan's most prestegious marathon events, and the anime follows the group's creation and training to eventually compete in the marathon. Each character represents different aspects of the philosophy and challenges of running, and their growth is the best part of the show.

            It's been a long semester though, it's time to pack my running shoes and <a href="seattle.html"><span>go home for the winter --></span></a>
